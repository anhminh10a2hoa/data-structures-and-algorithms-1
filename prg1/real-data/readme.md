# Real life data of affiliations and publications

The data has been modified and filtered from the original to fit the requirements of this course.
The scale of the coordinates is the same as the worldmap.hh in the worldmap subproject, therefore the map should align with the locations of the affiliations.

## Original data sources

The affiliation content data is from dblp.org and crossref.org
The publication content data is from crossref.org
The geolocation data for the affiliations is from positionstack.com
